@node text "Playing with text"
Here are some things that can be done with text:

Escape characters: at-sign (\@), backslash (\\)
Special characters: äöüß§

@{b}bold @{ub}@{i}italic @{ui}@{u}underline@{uu}
@{b}bold @{i}bold+italic @{i}all@{uu}bold+italic @{ui}bold @{ub}
@{b}bold @{i}bold+italic @{i}all@{ui}bold+underline @{ub}underline @{uu}

Here is some text from an embedded file:
@embed "embedded.txt"
And here we are back again in the main document.
@endnode


@node Preformatted "Preformatted Text"
Here is some preformatted text.
This means viewers and converters
will preserve line breaks as specified
in the source document.
@endnode


@node WordWrapped "Wordwrapped Text"
@wordwrap
Here is some wordwrapped text, meaning that every line in the source code is treated as paragraph. While this looks nice for the reader, it is a PITA for the author.
Take a look at the source to see what I mean.
@endnode


@node SmartWrapped "Smartwrapped Text"
@smartwrap
This text uses smartwrap, which means a single
line break will not start a new paragraph. This is
nice for the author because unlike with wordwrap,
the text can be split over several lines without the
need for horizontal scrolling.

To start a new paragraph, simply leave an empty
line.

Like this.

And this.

See what I mean?

Probably not unless you took a closer look at the
source code.

@node MonoSpaced "Monospaced Node"
@font Topaz.font 9
Unlike the rest of the document, this node uses a monospaced font.

Which is nice for ASCII art, so here's a classic:

         (__)
         (oo)                       U
  /-------\\/                    /---V
 / |     ||                    * |--|                       .
*  ||----||
   ^^    ^^
Cow at 1 meter.         Cow at 100 meters.        Cow at 10,000 meters.
