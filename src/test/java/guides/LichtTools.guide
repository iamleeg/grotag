@node Introduction "LichtTools Documentation - Introduction"

Introduction
************

When I was young, someone gave me a bulb for a birthday present. The great thing about this bulb was, when screwed into a lamp, there was light. This turned out to be especially useful for reading books. Even if it was dark outside!

But after some years, my sweet little bulb died without any warning at all. This was the darkest day of my life.

I felt very depressed for quite a long time. I even thought about committing suicide, because people always tell about a light at the end of a tunnel - this just had to be my little bulb!

But maybe then I would not be able to read books again, so this was no solution.

Luckily, I remembered my good old Amiga and decided to make my sweet little bulb immortal by programming a bulb-simulator...

This is for you, bulby! <snif>

@NODE Usage "How to use it"
@TOC Main

Usage
*****

The LichtTools-package consists of three tools:

         @{" Licht     " LINK licht}
         @{" Finster   " LINK finster}
         @{" Finster2  " LINK finster2}

To start via Workbench, simply click the icons WBlicht/WBfinster/WBfinster2.

To start via CLI, type "licht"/"finster"/"finster2".


@ENDNODE

@NODE licht "Licht"
@TOC Usage

@{b}Licht@{ub} (light)

Licht simulates a fully functional bulb. Though not with the full strength of a real 100W-bulb, it provides still enough light to read a book in front of the monitor.

If you finished reading, you can abort the simulation pressing the left mouse button.

@ENDNODE

@NODE finster "Finster"
@TOC Usage

@{b}Finster@{ub} (dark)

Real bulb only can spend light. They can not spend darkness (which is a great disadvantage).

In order to do so, the marvelous "Finster"-tools has been included into the LichtTools package.

As an additional feature, it can also be used as a real screen-blanker.

If you finished starring into the dark, you can abort the simulation pressing the left mouse button.

@ENDNODE

@NODE finster2 "Finster2"
@TOC Usage

@{b}Finster2@{ub} (dark2) (dark, too)

This tool is an enhanced version of dark, especially written for Lukas Angermayer.

He owned a 17" monitor (non-15KHz), attached to a Picasso-II-graphics board, and a 14" monitor (15KHz).

When working in a Picasso-screenode, the 14" monitor just displayed flickering, annoying garbage.

Finster2 darkens the 15KHz display (14" monitor) and leaves the Picasso-screen active.
